        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>

        <p>I must first say that I have much difficulty doing self reflection, I find myself coming up quite blank at times. My mind seems to hit a roadblock when I don't know what to say about such an open and deep question.
            I would say that I am as a person relatively well rounded, I seem to have both the positive and negative sides of each characteristic present that shows at different times. I will premise that about the only part of me that isn't quiet as balanced is my loving/caring side. 
            I love looking after people that I love. In the past I have had that taken to far. This is evident in one of my previous relationships, I was taken advantage of and manipulated emotionally. 
            I that realized with the help of a counselor that it wasn't healthy for me to try and “prop up” this person and myself emotionally and financially. The breaking point was when they left me in their total tip of room, that I had said that I would help them clean up, they then tied manipulate me into doing it all by myself, whilst they left and went and saw family. 
            I would say that this experience told me that selfcare is far more important than caring for other. One cannot care for others without caring for themselves. Ethically it was my main duty to care for myself first. This experience changed how much and how far I was willing to go in the future.
