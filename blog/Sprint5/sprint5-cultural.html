        "What surprised me the most about learning core is..."</h2>
        <P>
            What surprised me most about learning core is that, just how interesting some of these topics are. Grow mindset and how that actually affects us how just knowing that your brain can change makes it easier to change. <br>
            I all ready knew about neuroplasticity and how the brain is really good at learning things. what I didn't know is how much knowing this actually changed how you learn.

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            How bad my perfectionism is.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How much trouble getting things out of my head and actually knowing how to do things is.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I'd like to think that I'm mostly rather humble but at times im really not...

                            The growth mindset. and how much that not thinking like that influenced my life

                            Most of the self critical thought

                        <li>
                            Because a well rounded person who is able to learn is much better in any and all jobs.

                        <li>
                            I  dont think that at all. Learning about yourself is really important. <br>
                            I know from my previous schooling that self improvement is key to being a good human being.
